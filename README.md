## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS/HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.Js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, PassportJS and Sessions

This project is a web application for tutors to help provide a service allowing for storing and copying class session feedback information which can be sent to the client via any choice of text messaging!

It uses Node.js and Express for the back end, and vanilla JS/CSS with a EJS templating engine for the front end. For authentication Local OAuth is used via PassportJs and SessionJS Middleware

The goal of this project was to experiment and develop my personal coding abilty and understanding of full-stack web development, as well as develop a solution to a problem I am currently experiencing!
